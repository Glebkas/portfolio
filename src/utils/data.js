    aboutMe:
      "I’m a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I’m based in Israel, but I’m happy working remotely and have experience in remote teams. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. I love being out in nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or cycling. I’d love you to check out my work. ",
