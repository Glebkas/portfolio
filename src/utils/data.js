            "I'm a junior Full Stack developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices, and writing clean JavaScript. I mostly use React when writing JavaScript code, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I'm based in Israel, but I'm happy working remotely and have experience working remotely. When I'm not coding, you'll find me taking photos outdoors. I'd love you to check out my work.",
